        <h2>Cultural Differences in the Experience of Trauma and Adversity</h2>
        <p>​In this new line of research, our lab explores how culture shapes the ways in which people cope with adverse life experiences in both the public and private spheres. We are currently exploring this question across the lifespan in studies with children and adults to understand how cultural differences can translate to psychological and behavioral differences following adverse life events.</p>

        <h2>Culture and Education</h2>
        <p> In this research we seek to understand how culture influences educational attainment. Specifically, we are interested in: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>How culture shapes individuals’ educational expectations and experiences</li>
            <li>How the cultural environment of U.S. educational systems can lead to cultural mismatches between students’ self-views and the cultural norms endorsed by U.S. higher education</li>
            <li>The ability of culturally tailored interventions to improve academic outcomes for diverse student groups (e.g., First-generation college students, racial minority students)</li>
          </ol>
        <p>Our lab is currently investigating the use of culturally minded academic interventions with teachers and school systems in the Seattle area, with the ultimate goal of creating change at the community level. This longitudinal study is funded by the Raikes Foundation.</p>
